Please let me know if you have trouble accessing any of the files and I will get that fixed right away. I wasn't able to get it to fully run, at the very end, was having some trouble with PyMongo, sorry about that! 

I did use Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT to check my work and assist with errors that I didn't understand I also asked for assistance from my instructor throughout class on portions I did not understand. Please let me know if you have questions.

Thank you! Laura Magallanes
